leJOS-RCX-Tools
===============
A visual interface for leJOS. RCXDownload automatically sets the JDK-, leJOS- and ClassPaths, compiles the chosen Java-Source, shows the compiler messages and is able to link and load both the compiled classes and the leJOS-firmware.

RCXDOWNLOAD AND RCXDIRECTMODE README
------------------------------------


Installation
------------

RCXDownload / RCXDirectMode are currently working under Windows and Linux.


1. First, check if JDK1.1, JDK1.2, JDK1.3, JDK1.4 or JDK1.5 is already installed 
   on your computer (You can get them at java.sun.com).

2. Install leJOS for Windows/Linux.
   (If you would like to use leJOS exclusively with "RCXDownload" and
   "RCXDirectMode", you don't have to alter any CLASSPATH-settings)

4. Download and extract the archive "RCXTools_1_6.zip" (Windows) or 
   "RCXTools_1_6.tar.gz" (Linux).

5. Windows: You could start the programs doubleclicking "RCXDownload.bat"
            or "RCXDirectMode.bat" within the RCXTools-directory.

   Linux:   Simply go to the RCXTools directory and type 'make'.
            You could start RCXDownload and RCXDirectMode using the
            commands rcxdownload or rcxdirectmode within the
            RCXTools-directory.

6. First of all, there will appear a dialogbox.
   Choose the paths to the leJOS- and JDK-directory as well as the serial
   device to the IR-tower of the Lego Mindstorms Invention-Systems.


Before using "RCXDirectMode", you have to download the program for direct
communication to your RCX (Button "Download Direct-RCX").
