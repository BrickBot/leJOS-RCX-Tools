    reply; the package does not differ anymore from that used for direct
    communication in pc-sided programs).

    Koala Graphics that comes with a platform-independent FilenameFilter.

RCXTools v1.1
-------------

  - Placed communication for RCXDirectMode in a seperate package 'rcxdirect'
    (this 'rcxdirect' package differs quite a bit from that used for direct
    communication in pc-sided java programs / 
    see http://rcxtools.sourceforge.net/rcxdirect/e_index.html)
  - Added TextLCD.print panel to RCXDirectMode (pressing virtual "On-Off"-
    Button will skip to application title)
  - RCXDownload is resizable now!!
  - Set number of chosen java sources from 10 entries to 20 (RCXDownload).
  - Added 'Reset'-Button to RCXDownload: List of java sources and the message
    area can be reset.
  - RCXDownload exclusively accepts files with .java suffix
  - Added a FilenameFilter to RCXDownload (Doesn't work on Win32; the bug id 
    is 4031440, and it can be seen at the Java Developer Connection. It's
    just for an upcoming linux version.)
  - Made installation easier using a completely modified version of install.java
    from Andrew Hunt, Toolshed Technologies Inc.
    The Installation-GUI can also install leJOS and javax.comm-Driver if the
    needed zip-Files are in the same folder as install.class
